  CAVEAT:
  It is very important that f returns a result that has been
  realized for all parts in which special conditions can arise.

  As long as f returns a fully realized result, all is good.

  Any conditions raised lazily after f returns will result in
  unexpected bahaviour: Either they will be unmanaged, or
  they will be managed by whatever handlers are at the time
  existing in the dynamic thread execution context."
